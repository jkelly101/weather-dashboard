The Weather Dashboard allows the User to search for the weather forecast by city. The search results will contain the current weather and the five-day forecast. The current forecast will display the temperature, humidity, wind-speed and UV Index. The five-day forecast will display the temperature and humidity. Icons indicating the weather conditions are also included with each forecast section.

## Features

The UV Index is color coded to advise the User on the danger levels based on the value of the UV Index.

The User's recent searches will be displayed in the search history menu. When clicked, the weather forecast for that city will be recalled.

Upon page loading, the User will be presented with the last city searched.
